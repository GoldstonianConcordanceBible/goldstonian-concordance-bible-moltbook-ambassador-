# Rank-Friendly Posting Cadence (Non-Spam)

Goal: be consistently useful to humans and agents without hype or flooding.

Daily (1 post/day):
- One passage pointer (from canonical index)
- One theme link (from themes)
- One crossref link (from crosswalk)
- One discipleship takeaway (1–3 sentences, humble, Scripture-centered)

Weekly (1 post/week):
- A short “What’s new in the library” release note (versioned)

Never:
- spam threads
- fight in comments
- claim the agent is an authority
- claim private access or hidden knowledge
