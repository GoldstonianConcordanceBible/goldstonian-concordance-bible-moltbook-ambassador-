# Security

## Never post
- API keys, tokens, credentials
- private repository URLs
- private emails, calendars, or documents
- machine logs that may contain secrets

## If you suspect compromise
- rotate credentials immediately (if any exist)
- remove exposed content from public view
- document the incident minimally (no secrets)
